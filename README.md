UGA Hacks 8 project.

This project was created with the MERN stack.

Byte's Bucket list is for people who love traveling and games. This app allows users to track their mileage 
and choose their destinations. Each mile a user travels with a destination entered results in 10 points. Once 
a user reaches their destination they must verify that they have made it online. Once the systems verifies the 
location the points are added immediately and displayed on their account. If they are high enough they could be
displayed on the sites leaderboard!
